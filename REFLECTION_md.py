# Reflection

## 1. What were the key things you learned this week?
I learned about refactoring code to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and how to structure Python programs using functions.

## 2. What was the most challenging part of this weekâ€™s practical?
The most challenging part was understanding how to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable functions.

## 3. How did you solve any problems you encountered?
I solved problems by carefully reading the instructions, referring to previous examples, and using the refactoring tools in my IDE.

## 4. What will you do differently next time?
Next time, I will plan out my functions and their responsibilities more clearly before starting to code.

## 5. What is one thing you would like to learn or improve upon next week?
I would like to improve my understanding of more advanced Python concepts such as classes and object-oriented programming.
